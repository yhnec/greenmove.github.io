                          <h3>Solar energy</h3>
                          <p>Solar energy is energy coming from the sun. Solar energy is the most abundant and sustainable renewable energy source. It is based on the use of solar radiation to convert it into electrical or thermal energy.</p>
                          <p>Operating principle of solar panels:<br>Solar panels or photovoltaic modules consist of many solar photovoltaic cells (solar cells). When sunlight hits these cells, electrons are released and begin to move along the conductors. This is called the photoelectric effect. The current is stored in batteries for later use or collected and used to power electrical appliances.</p>
                          <p>Heat Conversion:<br>
                            Sunlight can be converted into electrical energy or used to produce heat. Solar thermal collectors are used to collect heat. This is a device for collecting thermal energy from the Sun. In such a system, solar radiation is absorbed by special panels and transferred to a coolant, which transfers heat to the heating system or plumbing system.</p>

                          <h3 >Wind energy</h3>
                          <p><br>Wind energy is energy obtained from the movement of wind air masses. The main task is to convert the kinetic energy of air masses in the atmosphere into electrical, mechanical, thermal, etc.</p>
                          <p>Wind turbine operating principle:<br>
                            The wind flow spins the moving part, which transmits rotation to the generator and an electric current is generated in the system. It goes to batteries, from which inverters are powered, converting the resulting current into a standard voltage and frequency suitable for consumer devices.</p>
                          <p>Design and types of wind power plants:<br>
                            Wind farms consist of many wind generators and use wind energy to generate electricity.
                            Stations are classified by functionality: mobile and stationary, by location: coastal, offshore, land, floating and by type of design: rotor and vane. Paddle stations have the greatest efficiency. Although the distribution of such stations has a specific configuration and is not found everywhere.</p>

                          <h3>Geothermal energy</h3>
                          <p>Geothermal energy is based on the use of thermal energy from the Earth's interior to produce electrical energy at geothermal power plants or directly for heating or hot water supply.</p>
                          <p>Operating principle of a geothermal installation:<br>
                            The operating principle of geothermal heating involves the use of heat pumps. A geothermal heat pump is a device that takes heat from the environment and transfers it to the heating and hot water supply system. There are two options for placing the heat exchanger: vertical and horizontal. The main difference is the location of the outer contour.</p>
                          <p>Types of Geothermal Plants and How to Use Geothermal Energy:<br>
                            It is important to use geothermal energy where there are natural underground thermal waters, volcanic activity and geysers. Geothermal energy can be extracted using a heat pump installation.
                            There are two types of geotramal installations: The first is based on the use of hot springs, and the second is based on the use of low-grade heat from the earth.</p>

                  Ireland mainly uses wind energy, solar photovoltaic systems, biomass and biogas. Almost all wind power in Ireland is generated onshore. However, the Irish government plans to build 5 GW of offshore wind capacity, with a target of 35 GW.
                  Ireland's installed solar PV capacity is one of the lowest in Europe, at just over 2 MW in 2015. Projections for future installed capacity growth vary widely, from 500 MW a year to 3,700 MW with government support."

                  In Switzerland, the focus in the field of renewable energy such as hydropower, wood, solar energy or ambient heat is conversion into electricity and district heating. The main source of renewable energy in the country for decades has been hydropower with a share of about 60%. The share of renewable energy sources, such as biomass, wind energy, and especially solar energy, has increased significantly in recent years. Over the past 10 years, heat pumps have been used in ¾ of new buildings and this share will increase in the future as well as the share of district heating, the use of wood as an energy source and solar energy.

Despite efforts to increase renewable energy production, the country's limited space and infrastructure prevent Liechtenstein from fully meeting its domestic needs from renewable energy sources alone.
                  Liechtenstein has used hydroelectric power since the 1920s as its main source of domestic energy production. Hydroelectric power production provided approximately 18-19% of domestic needs.
In recent decades, renewable energy efforts in Liechtenstein have also expanded to solar energy production. Most solar energy is generated by photovoltaic panels mounted on buildings (usually rooftops), rather than by dedicated solar power plants." class="count" d="m 347.23215,617.32575

The share of green energy in the kingdom's energy balance is already 26%. Now hydroelectric power stations and nuclear power plants provide about 80% of the country's energy balance.

Renewable energy sources include wind, solar, biomass and geothermal energy. Poland's energy sector is the fifth largest in Europe. In the future, Poland plans to generate at least 50% of its electricity from renewable sources and have some nuclear power capacity, by which time coal will no longer generate electricity. Poland's energy sector will gradually switch to alternative energy sources, while the country intends to develop nuclear energy, wind generators and solar power plants." class="count"

In 2016, renewable sources provided 29% of the country's total energy consumption. The main contribution was made by 26 hydroelectric power plants, while solar and wind power plants provided only 5% of the electricity produced. Croatia also intends to create a national center that will promote the transition to green energy and resource conservation policies. Currently, Croatia's green energy is mainly produced by hydropower. In the near future, the country will actively develop wind and solar generators. Because of this, electricity tariffs will increase in Croatia." class="count" d="m 405.89489,663.07484

Thus, Montenegro has joined the limited number of small powers that can boast that they receive all their energy from renewable sources. There are two hydroelectric power stations in Montenegro. These hydroelectric power plants have been operating for many years and only partially covered the state's needs; Montenegro imported energy in previous years.

First of all, there is a good opportunity for the development of solar photovoltaic and thermal energy. In addition, Serbia has quite large reserves of biomass, which can be effectively used to generate heat and electricity. There are also prospects for using wind energy - the average annual speed reaches 2-4 m/s in the country. The main role in the country is played by biomass - wood waste, etc., which is burned at special stations. Unfortunately, Serbia has not yet taken full advantage of all the opportunities, but in the future there is every prospect of raising the share of renewable energy sources to ≈ 35%." class="count" d="m 497.82688,635.31637
